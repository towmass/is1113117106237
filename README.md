## Author's Notes
- The website was developed and tested on the Macbook Air (13-inch, Early 2014) running macOS Sierra version 10.12.6.
- The editor `Visual Studio Code` was used.
- VSC was used for making commits directly to the GitHub repository.
- **Large amount of commits was caused mainly because of PHP scripts** and Heroku deployment testing _**(C9 was not used for real-time testing).**_
- CV part has a non-dropdown menu implemented because of indentation bugs caused by the Bootstrap.
- Sports page intentionally uses on-load animations as a demonstration of the CSS possibilities.
- Travel page uses `pagePiling.js` as instructed.
- E-Business part has additional features implemented such as:
  - Random receipt code generator (saved into the session variable)
  - Date of purchase (saved into the session variable)
  - Last purchase page which prints all the session variables
  - Validator which checks whether there was a purchase made or not (last purchase page changes its content according to that)
  - Button for session destroy
- Please note there were several methods used during the process and some script were **purposely not deleted** (only commented and left for possible later use elsewhere)
- The author currently studies principles of the responsive design (Unfortunately, responsiveness will not be applied on this project because of time reasons. However, every future project will be coded according to responsive standards.)
