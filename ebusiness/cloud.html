    <h1 class="heading">About Cloud</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Since you might be new to cloud services, let us explain some of the
        <span class="strong">basic terms</span>. Just
        <span class="link">hover</span> over the boxes below to get your answers or
        <span class="strong">click</span> on given box to access service's official website.
        <p>

          <a class="tip" href="https://www.salesforce.com/saas/">Software as a Service
            <span class="tiptext">Software as a service is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead
              of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex
              software and hardware management.</span>
          </a>

          <a class="tip" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Platform as a Service
            <span class="tiptext">AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment that lets you write, run, and debug your code
              with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential
              tools for popular programming languages including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don’t need to install
              files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you
              can work online on your projects from anywhere.

          <a class="tip" href="https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/">Infrastructure as a Service
            <span class="tiptext">Infrastructure as a Service contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking
              features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service
              provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most
              similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.</span>
          </a>

          <a class="tip" href="https://gsuite.google.co.nz/intl/en_nz/products/gmail/">Communication as a Service
            <span class="tiptext">Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from
              a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging
              (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. CaaS has evolved along
              the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).
